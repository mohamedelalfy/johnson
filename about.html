                    <p>Window Film can enhance the existing appearance of your building, by choosing a product that
                        complements the existing elements of your structure. If you choose one of our Architectural
                        products the look of the building can be completely transformed into something it never was
                        before. If your interest is in energy savings, there are many types of new windows that can be
                        installed to achieve energy conservation; window film can achieve the same results at a lower
                        cost. Unlike most building retrofit projects undertaken, you will find that the installation of
                        window film is a minor disruption to your busy life. No moving out, no need to not use a certain
                        room for a period of time, it's fast and easy when performed by a professional installer. A
                        large concern in this day and age is personal safety; glass itself is a dangerous product as
                        most glass types are designed to shatter when they break. Any window film installed on any glass
                        type will help to keep the fragments intact, stopping the potential danger of flying glass
                        fragments and large pieces. Certain products can be installed or reduce the ability to see
                        inside your building, home or car. This is an added benefit against vandalism and possible
                        theft. By reducing the view from outside of the building or car, the potential intruder is not
                        enticed to steal your belongings.

                        <p> When thinking of window film, we all know about tinting our cars, which has been around for
                            almost as long as there have been cars. Everyone wants to reduce the glare encountered when
                            driving and protect the vehicle’s interior. As we drive around town we always see companies
                            advertising automobile window tinting, but did you ever think that the same kind of product
                            might bring advantages to your building? Your car is not the largest monetary investment you
                            will ever make, that’s reserved for real estate, whether a commercial building, your home,
                            office or rental unit. Why not give the largest investment you will ever make the same
                            protection? Whether you are interested in privacy, safety, energy savings or appearance the
                            benefits of window film will bring the same levels of protection with a greater return on
                            investment. The temperature changes that buildings experience are slower and felt more by
                            humans than the changes in your car. Sure your cars gets hot, but leave the windows or doors
                            open and turn on the AC in a short period of time the temperature will adjust to a
                            comfortable environment, but not so with a building. Buildings are not conducive to quick
                            temperature turn a rounds. Automobiles are small spaces with limited amounts of air which
                            allows air to circulate more quickly. As we all know trying to cool or even heat a building
                            in which the HVAC has gone out, takes quite awhile. The addition of any kind of window film
                            on a structure will assist with the amount of heat or cold that escapes from the untreated
                            window.

                    <div class="component-description">
                        <p> It is impossible today, to ignore the need for conservation in a wide variety of products,
                            whether those products are consumables or not makes no difference. We are asked to reuse,
                            repurpose and reduce our consumption. We all want to do the best we can to preserve the
                            natural resources that we are blessed with today so they are available for future
                            generations. It is important not only to examine how we use resources, but also how we can
                            create new ones. The process to produce window film creates a lower carbon footprint than
                            the manufacturing of glass. Should a problem develop with professionally installed window
                            film, it can easily be removed and quickly replaced without the need to purchase a new
                            window. The application of window film will assist with lowering the costs to run your HVAC
                            unit. Not only will you save on the utilities costs associated with these units, but the
                            units themselves will not have to run as long or hard to achieve the required
                            cooling/heating , thereby extending the life of these units. A win for everyone.
